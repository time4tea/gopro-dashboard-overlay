# Changelog

Newest changes are always in [README.md](README.md)
- 0.96.0 [Feature] Hopefully add support for older gopro files when joining. [#129](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/129) Thanks [@FFMbyBicycle](https://github.com/FFMbyBicycle) for raising and some example code. 
- 0.95.0 [Feature] Add api key support for geocode.xyz - [#117](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/117) Thanks [@mishuha](https://github.com/mishuha) for raising.
- 0.94.0 [Change] Update docker image to python3.11/ffmpeg 6.0 
- 0.93.0 [Feature] Support for *fully gpu* decoding/overlay/encoding. Huge performance increase now possible. It takes a bit of work, but now can render at 12x realtime. See [docs/bin/PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md](docs/bin/PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md)
  - [Breaking] Remove support for `--output-size` as it didn't really work properly anyway. 
- 0.92.0 [Feature] `--double-buffer` - EXPERIMENTAL double-buffering. Potentially much faster rendering, but may not work on all architectures. Speed improvements highly dependent on `ffmpeg` performance. Likely much faster when using `--generate overlay`. Feedback welcomed.
- 0.91.0 [Fix] Ignore FIT data items that don't have a GPS location. [#122](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/122) Thanks [@patkoscsaba](https://github.com/patkoscsaba) for raising.
- 0.90.0 [Change] `cairo-circuit` now draws much more quickly. 
- [Change] Map rendering caches tile images more efficiently, so draws more quickly.
- 0.89.0 [Feature] New component `cairo-gauge-round-annotated` - A bit like a car speedometer - See docs [docs/xml/examples/06-cairo-gauge-round-annotated](docs/xml/examples/06-cairo-gauge-round-annotated)
- 0.88.0 [Fix] Journey Map broke when no there were no locked GPS points in the movie.
  - Thanks [@shahargli](https://github.com/shahargli) for reporting
- 0.87.0 [Fix/Breaking Possibly] `chart` - discovered a few bugs, now fixed. Removed `alpha`, instead use alpha of each colour.
- 0.86.0 [Feature] New component `cairo-gauge-marker` - a nice clean gauge component, with a marker for the current value.. See docs [docs/xml/examples/06-cairo-gauge-marker](docs/xml/examples/06-cairo-gauge-marker)
- 0.85.0 [Feature/Breaking Possibly] Add validation to attributes in layout files. This may cause some custom layouts to break! - But they wouldn't have been working as intended.
  - [Change/Breaking] Change some `zone-bar` attribute names, aiming for standardisation
  - [Change/Breaking] Change some `cairo-circuit-map` attribute names, aiming for standardisation
- 0.84.0 [Feature] New component `zone-bar` - a 3-zone bar control that can be used for HR/Cadence/Power zones. See docs in [docs/xml/examples/07-zone-bar](docs/xml/examples/07-zone-bar)
  - Many thanks to [@jchinte](https://github.com/jchinte) for contributing!
- 0.83.0 [Change] No longer require --overlay-size when using --use-gpx-only, but supplying input video
  - [Fix] Give better error message when video and GPX don't overlap in time, but told to sync 
  - Thanks to [@mfloryan](https://github.com/mfloryan) for reporting both of these
- 0.82.0 [Change] Support for changing units in layouts from the command line. Use `--units-speed` etc to control. Examples are in [docs/bin](docs/bin)
  - Thanks to [@matzeruegge](https://github.com/matzeruegge) for the suggestion.
- 0.81.0 [Fix] gopro-rename was broken when using `--dirs` - added tests so hopefully won't reoccur. Thanks to [matzeruegge](https://github.com/matzeruegge) for reporting
- 0.80.0 [Fix] Use speeds from GPX file, in preference to GoPro file, when using GPX and GoPro together.
  - [Change] Bump Required python version to 3.10
- 0.79.0 [Fix] Changed GPS filtering reporting, it was a bit off.
- 0.78.0 [Fix] Gradient calculation had become disabled.
  - [Feature] Can now filter GPS points by max DOP `--gps-dop-max`
  - [Feature] Can now filter GPS points by max Speed `--gps-speed-max` `--gps-speed-max-units`
  - [Feature] Can now filter GPS points by bounding box - Useful if a few points claim to be locked, but are far away. Load GPX file into mapping software to see bounding box easily, for now. `--gps-bbox-lon-lat`
  - [Change] Outputs except for generated files are now to stderr rather than stdout
  - [Feature] `gopro-to-csv.py` and `gopro-to-gpx.py` now support `--only-locked` and `--every` to limit number of points (also GPS point filters, as above)
  - [Change] Change in the way chart handles missing values - stops chart going to 0.
  - Updated various library dependency versions.
- 0.77.0 [Change] Disable speed and other calculations when GPS is not locked - stops unbelievable values
  - [Change] changes to GPS parsing, should make detection of GPS lock more accurate (some 'not locked' values used to be included) still not perfect h/t [@falumas](https://github.com/falumas)
  - [Change] add new widget "gps-lock-icon" at top of screen to show GPS lock - hopefully not too intrusive - can switch off with `--exclude`
  - [Change] interpolate GPX/FIT tracks so they update every 0.1s - h/t [@0x10](https://github.com/0x10)
- 0.76.0 [New Feature] New widget - "cairo_circuit_map" - Much nicer looking circuit map, and first widget that uses new optional "cairo" library.
  - See examples [Cairo Circuit Map](docs/xml/examples/06-cairo-circuit-map/README.md)
- 0.75.0 Fixing some issues with True values in use of supplied or calculated values
  - Thanks to [@Timmy-485](https://github.com/Timmy-485) for data files showing the issue.
- 0.74.0 Experimental Support for speed from GPX files - using Garmin Extension h/t [@Timmy-485](https://github.com/Timmy-485) 
  - Fix bug introduced in 0.73.0 to do with parsing map api keys.
- 0.73.0 Support `--cache-dir` and `--config-dir` which should make use of profiles and map caches easier when using Docker
- 0.72.0 Fix #42 - Data out of sequence when using joined files. h/t [@IbnGit](https://github.com/IbnGit) 
- 0.71.0 Fix #84 - Error introduced when updating to use pathlib - Added test so shouldn't reoccur. h/t [@j0ker-npw](https://github.com/j0ker-npw) 
- 0.70.0 Using GPX/FIT files - file extension is now case insensitive - #83 - h/t [@j0ker-npw](https://github.com/j0ker-npw) 
- 0.69.0 
  - New Program:- gopro-layout.py
    - This should help if you want to create your own layouts. Just point this to a layout file, and it will render a frame each time the layout file changes, so you can see your changes "live"
    - Some layout examples are now in [examples/layout](examples/layout)
    - Minor tweaks to `text`, `metric` and `chart` to control outline width and colour
  - New widget type `circuit_map` shows a simple plot of the path, but no map graphics. See [docs/xml/examples/06-circuit-map](docs/xml/examples/06-circuit-map)
- 0.68.0 EXPERIMENTAL support for FIT files - Use just like a GPX file, either supplementing the GoPro or by itself.
  - Not expecting any major issues, with FIT support, but I don't have a huge number of test files.
- 0.67.0 EXPERIMENTAL support for parsing camera orientation. This means it's now possible to show pitch/roll/yaw.
  - But I'm not 100% on the maths, particularly around the rotation axes - so maybe it's not quite right.
  - Use `ori.pich` `ori.roll` `ori.yaw` in widgets/metrics. They have a unit of radians - Feedback welcomed!
- 0.66.0 Fix #78 - Crash when GPS5 packets have zero entries.
  - Add accelerometer entries to csv output 
- 0.65.0 Parse "power" from GPX files. Thanks to [@kfhdk](https://github.com/kfhdk)
  - See [docs/xml/examples/07-metrics](docs/xml/examples/04-metrics) for examples of how to use
  - Also example layout in layouts/power-1920x1080.xml
- 0.64.0 Bump version only - no changes

  - Huge thanks to [@ptanov](https://github.com/ptanov) for code and others for suggestions!
- 0.58.0 Chart component now has configurable colours and size - see [docs/xml/examples/07-chart](docs/xml/examples/07-chart)
- 0.57.0 Experimental support for non-real-time (timelapse/timewarp) videos
  - Thanks to [@ptanov](https://github.com/ptanov)
- 0.56.0 Remove possible divide by zero error - only likely in timewarp/timelapse videos - I think
  - Minor changes to ffmpeg code, should have no visible effect
- 0.55.0 Huge improvement to View performance - used in chart - now charts with short windows are useable.
- 0.54.0 Fix [#60](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/60) h/t [@remintz](https://github.com/remintz)
  - Some (older?) camera's don't have ORIN in ACCL and GYRO streams, so use a default
- 0.53.0 New feature for a frame - fade out to edge - see [docs](docs/xml/examples/09-frame) - thanks [@ptanov](https://github.com/ptanov)
  - Fix to GPX file loading - also, thanks [@ptanov](https://github.com/ptanov)
- 0.52.0 Update gopro-to-gpx.py to allow smaller GPX files (see help)

  - Use metrics `accl.x` `accl.y` and `accl.z` in any widget or metric text
  - New component `bar` - see [bar docs](docs/xml/examples/07-bar)
  - Updated chart can now chart (probably) any metric - see [chart docs](docs/xml/examples/07-chart)
- 0.48.0 Fix [#48](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/48) - h/t [@osresearch](https://github.com/osresearch)  
  - allow 'km' units where appropriate
- 0.47.0 Fix [#47](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/47) - h/t [@osresearch](https://github.com/osresearch)  
  - using --layout-xml abc on the command line now implies --layout xml
  - Fix [#31](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/31) h/t [@tve](https://github.com/tve)
  - When alt isn't available, don't blow up trying to calculate gradient
- 0.46.0 New component `compass-arrow` - see layout docs [examples](docs/xml/examples/README.md)
  - progress on support of time-lapse and time-warp files, but they don't work properly yet
  - built-in layout for 2.7k files
- 0.45.0 New Program `gopro-rename.py` - turn idiosyncratically named gopro files GX0100123.MP4 into 20220405-123416-london-england.MP4 using either provided description,
  - or looks up the location from the GPS, and makes file name from that.
  - uses the GPS timestamp to determine the time of the file. 
  - now gopro files will sort properly in your file viewer
  - also works around gopro camera drift, clock is always wrong.
  - can rename whole folders of files 
- 0.44.0 Add [PR#44](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/pull/34) for extracting GPMF to ndjson. Thanks [@gregbaker](https://github.com/gregbaker)
- 0.43.0 Support for [Geoapify](https://geoapify.com/) maps, as well as existing [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com/) and [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
  - Small improvements in API Key handling. See [map styles docs](docs/maps/README.md)
- 0.42.0 Experimental threading mode `--thread` which just sends data to ffmpeg on a background thread. 
  - The result of lots of experimentation on timing, but basically if the GPU is maxed out, that's a limiting factor.
  - This gets a marginal performance gain of about 0.2frames/s for me. Use `nvtop` to check the "ENC" load on the GPU. 
  - Demonstrate that on a `null` ffmpeg, we can generate about 60 overlay frames a second, or 6 seconds/second
- 0.41.0 Allow alpha channel in colours everywhere. This means all text, backgrounds etc can now specify alpha component for colours
  - See docs for text component for [example](docs/xml/examples/01-simple-text/README.md)
- 0.40.0 BIG CHANGE - Hopefully align metadata with video *much* better. Please please raise issues if there are problems.
  - This has been tested with GOPRO Hero 9 and GOPRO Hero 7 - which use two different timing schemes, and appears to work.
  - This changes the way that GPX metadata is aligned with the track, which should also make it better
  - This might change how points with large DOP are rendered... feedback welcomed about how to do this best
- 0.39.0 Fix [#29](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/29)  
- 0.38.0 Fix [#30](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/30) thanks @tve

    - (Change in behaviour) Use input file framerate as output file framerate. This may make output files bigger.
        - A more comprehensive mechanism to control ffmpeg options is planned for a later release
- 0.30.0
    - Attempt to fix character encoding issues on Mac (can't test, as I don't have a Mac)

    - Add `frame` component - Draws a clipping maybe-rounded box to contain other components.
    - Add initial docs for XML layout
- 0.28.0
    - Only rerender moving map if it has moved since last frame - will be much quicker under certain circumstances
    - Refactorings in how map border/opacity is rendered (should have no visible effect, maybe marginally faster)
- 0.27.0
    - Fix [Issue #20](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/20) Minor improvement in GPX parsing.
      Hopefully more tolerant of GPX files that don't contain hr/cadence/temp extensions
- 0.26.0
    - (Change in behaviour) - Fix [Issue #17](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/17) Will now
      use local timezone when rendering datetimes. (H/T [@tve](https://github.com/tve) )
- 0.25.0
    - (Change in behaviour) - Will now use speed from datasource, in preference to calculated. This should make it much
      more stable, if the datasource supplies it. (GoPro does, GPX not)
- 0.24.0
    - Big internal restructuring of metadata parsing. Will make it easier to import GYRO/ACCL data soon. Incidentally,
